# Changelog

All notable changes. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): from 1.0.0, the `.mnx` format, the CLI and the runtime's public API change incompatibly only in a new major version.

## 1.4.0 — 2026-11-06

### Added

- **JSX components** (`.mnx.jsx` / `.mnx.tsx`): a function component compiles to the same custom element as an `.mnx` file. The function's name is the tag, destructured parameters are props, `on<Name>` parameters are events (`onValueChange(x)` fires `valuechange`), `children` is the default slot, a top-level `let` is state, and a top-level `const` that reads props or state is derived. `&&` / `? :` are conditionals and `.map()` with a `key` is a keyed list. It's lowered to the `.mnx` format with a source map, so every output and check works and errors point into the JSX. `.mnx` and JSX components import each other, and `@mnx/unplugin` resolves `.mnx.jsx` / `.mnx.tsx` imports with the same variant rules.
- **JavaScript expressions in templates**: beyond the build-time subset, any expression is accepted as code that runs in the browser: calls, arrow-function handlers that close over list items, list methods. Names follow the script (a `state()` is read with `.get()`), only props can be assigned, `emit()` in a template declares its event, and a runtime expression can be a prop default. The HTML output reports these as browser-only, as it does runtime-only script values.

## 1.3.0 — 2026-11-06

### Added

- **Server rendering for apps.** `@mnx/compiler` has `render(path, { props, slots })` (HTML plus the scoped CSS it needs) and `renderToString()`, throwing a `CompileError` with diagnostics. Compiled modules now load on a server: without a DOM, `define()` returns a stand-in that carries the element's `mnx` description, so adapters and framework SSR can import components. `@mnx/runtime/server` renders an element class (`renderToString(Element, { props, attributes, slots })`), and the plugin's server builds register each component's renderer, with its sources embedded.
- **Astro integration** (`@mnx/unplugin/astro`): `.mnx` components in Astro pages, server-rendered, static by default and hydrated with `client:*` directives. Props go to the component, other attributes to the host, children to slots.
- **Slot content as server HTML.** Slots can be HTML a server already rendered, kept as written: braces are text, and comments (hydration markers), `<script>`, unquoted and inline-handler attributes stay. Request `slotSource: "html"`, CLI `--slots-html`; `render()` uses it by default. Slotted elements are still marked for scoped styles.
- **Angular**: `MnxModel` from `@mnx/runtime/angular`, a standalone directive that makes an mnx element a form control (`ngModel`, `formControl`, `formControlName`) through its `<prop>` + `<prop>change` pair, with touched and disabled states. Published as partial declarations, so the Angular linker compiles it for AOT builds.
- **Svelte, Solid and Lit**: the plugin detects Solid, Preact and Svelte projects and gives their files the element itself; `--framework svelte|solid` typings (`svelte/elements`, Solid's `prop:`/`on:`). Tested in real apps, with Lit as a host too.
- **`mnix request`**: one JSON request on stdin, the response on stdout (what the WebAssembly build exposes). `@mnx/compiler` uses it when `mnx.wasm` is missing and `$MNX_COMPILER` names a native `mnix`.
- The plugin is tested building with Rollup, webpack and esbuild as well as Vite.

### Fixed

- Light-DOM slots keep a framework's markers with its content (a comment goes with the content after it, whitespace with the content before it), so Lit's parts and Svelte's anchors stay in one slot. Markers and whitespace alone don't fill a slot.
- The plugin found `.mnx` imports in `<script lang="ts">` too when watching a component's dependencies.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-11-06

### Added

- **`@mnx/compiler`**: the compiler as WebAssembly (`mnx-wasm`, a C-ABI shim over the new `handle_request`: a JSON request with every source in, a JSON response with output and diagnostics out). Same output as the CLI, checked by a parity test in CI. `@mnx/unplugin` uses it when no CLI is configured, so apps need no Rust toolchain.
- **`@mnx/language-server`**: diagnostics as you type, completion (directives, imported components, props, events, props in expressions), hover docs and go to definition, over LSP.
- **VS Code extension** (`editors/vscode`): TextMate grammar with embedded JavaScript/TypeScript/CSS/SCSS, language configuration, and the language server.
- **`--emit html-data`**: VS Code HTML custom data for mnx elements in `.html` files.
- **`mnix check --stdin`**: checks unsaved text as if it were at the given path.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-11-06

### Added

- **`mnix check`**: every error and warning in the given files, without writing output; exit status 1 on errors; `--format json` for editors and CI.
- **Scoped `<style>`**: light-DOM styles use native `@scope` and stop at slotted content, marked `data-mnx-slotted="<component>"`; shadow components adopt a shared sheet, with a `<style>` in their declarative shadow root for server rendering. Styles sit in the `components` cascade layer with Tailwind's layer order declared, so utilities and page CSS override them (`layer="…"` / `layer="none"` to change that). `:host` works in both modes. `--emit css` for the page; with `@mnx/unplugin`, `<style>` (including `lang="scss"`) goes through Vite's CSS pipeline, so Tailwind's `@apply` and `@reference` work. `adoptStyles()` brings app-wide CSS into shadow roots.
- **Prop defaults computed in the browser**: a default that uses runtime-only script values (or the browser's globals) is computed per element after the script runs, unless the prop was given. The HTML output asks for it via `--props` or the parent.
- **`<script lang="ts">`**: TypeScript component scripts, erasable syntax only, with types removed in place so positions are kept. Annotated bindings type the props they default, `emit<T>()` types event details, and the script's types are exported from the generated typings.

### Fixed

- The JavaScript output now checks how child components are used, as the HTML output does: unknown props (with suggestions), literal values of the wrong type, missing required props, and listeners for near misses of a child's events.
- A script binding that reads a browser global (`window`, `document`, `Math`, …) is runtime-only instead of an "used before it is declared" error.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-11-06

The first stable release: the `.mnx` format is frozen until 2.0, and both outputs support everything in it. Covers the compiler crate and CLI (`mnix`), `@mnx/runtime` and `@mnx/unplugin`. Licensed under ISC.

### Format

- **Single-file components.** An optional `<script>`, then a host tag that declares the custom element and its props: `title={title}` takes its default from the script, `label="Hi"` is a string default, a bare `name` is required. `shadow` opts into shadow DOM; `form-associated` makes the element a form control. A comment above the component is its description.
- **`{expr}`** in text and attributes, in a JavaScript subset with JavaScript's semantics (`?.` `??` `? :`, strict `==`, truthiness). Every name is checked in every branch, with "did you mean" suggestions.
- **Directives**: `mnx-if` / `mnx-else`, `mnx-each` (with `index` and `key`), `mnx-slot` (named, with fallbacks).
- **Templates may have any number of top-level nodes**: the host is the root.
- **Components using components**: `import './badge.mnx'` in the script; props are type-checked at the call site.
- **Events inferred from `emit("name", detail)`**, named like the platform's events (lowercase, no separators), with `@fires` documentation checked against the code.

### Outputs

- **HTML** (`--emit html`, the default): static, deterministic, escaped markup with the markers the runtime needs to hydrate it; child components rendered inline (declarative shadow DOM for shadow components). `--props` and `--slots` supply values.
- **JavaScript** (`--emit js`): a custom element on `@mnx/runtime`. Signal-backed props and typed attributes; template parts that bind to server markup without re-rendering (after a shape check); regions for `mnx-if` / `mnx-each`, with keyed rows moved by `moveBefore()`; light-DOM slots that stay live under frameworks managing the element's children; native `<slot>` in shadow components; pause on detach.
- **Custom Elements Manifest** (`--emit manifest`, schema 2.1.0) and **TypeScript declarations** (`--emit dts`, optionally `--framework react|vue`).
- **Warnings** for props that shadow built-in element properties (`hidden`, `title`, …).

### Runtime (`@mnx/runtime`)

- The TC39 Signals API (the browser's own when present), differential-tested against the proposal's reference polyfill; batched effects with ownership.
- Hooks: `state`, `computed`, `effect`, `watch`, `onMount`, `onUnmount`, `id`, `props`, `host`, `emit`; context on the Web Components Community Group Context Protocol (`createContext`, `provide`, `inject`); form controls on `ElementInternals` (`formValue`, `validity`, `onFormReset`, `onFormRestore`, `onFormDisabled`).
- Adapters: `@mnx/runtime/react` (React 18 and 19) and `@mnx/runtime/vue` (Vue 3), with two-way binding from `<prop>` + `<prop>change` pairs.
- Type declarations for every entry point.

### Build plugin (`@mnx/unplugin`)

- Compiles `.mnx` imports in Vite, Rollup, webpack, esbuild and Rspack. The importing file decides what it gets: a React component, a Vue component, or the element class. Typings are written next to each component.

### Changed from 0.2

- The `component:` / `prop` / `---` header, `{{ … }}` and the `mnix-` directives are replaced; see `docs/migrating-from-0.2.md`. The compiler rejects each old form with a hint.
- The minimum Rust version is 1.97 (required by the oxc JavaScript parser).

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-30

- Compile-time `mnix-if` / `mnix-else`, `mnix-each` over string lists, and default and named slots with fallbacks; `--slots` input.

## 0.1.0

- Static compiler: component header with typed props, one-root templates, escaped interpolation, URL safety, source diagnostics, atomic `--output`.
